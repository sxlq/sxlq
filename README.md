## 1.0 About me

Im sxlq, im 17 years old and i major in Cyber Security , Computer / Data Science, Machine Learning, Software Engineering and Networking. I am always working on new Projects despite how hard they are. I always have new ideas for my Projects and my Work. At the moment I am focused on finding network vulnerabilities and exploiting them. Also i am focused on kernel driver development. In these past four i found many different bugs, exploits and 0days for Discord, Instagram, Sleek, Twitter, Lieferando, OBS, Government Websites (Confidential) and took part in various Cyber Security projects through out the years of my Journey.

I am always on the lookout for new projects to work on and new people to collaborate with. Check out my repositories and feel free to reach out if you would like to work on any of my existing projects or if you think that I would be a good fit in your project. Im always glad for every single information i get and learn about stuff i don't know.
